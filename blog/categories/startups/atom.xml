    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s generation, you name a service and there&rsquo;s an app for it, but there are a very few light hearted fun apps which exploit humour.</p>

<p>Whenever I used to talk to my friends about my apps , I  got suggestions to make something for the youth, which is lively, cheerful, basically a leisure app for past time.
So I wanted to develop something different than a game or service oriented app : what our generation people wanted !</p>

<p>I saw the exponenetial growth and boom of Dubsmash and one day it clicked to me !
Why can&rsquo;t we just do the opposite ??
Take a sample video and just dub your voice !
Being actively involved in theatre , I always loved doing mimicry of various actors. It is one of the most popular hobbies. Be it Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s kkk .. Kiran or Salman Khan&rsquo;s commitment, it&rsquo;s always fun to immitate your favorite celebrity.
People have been doing it since centuries. Why not just automate and make it easy and convinient ?</p>

<p>The App is called Smashdub &ndash; your mimicry partner !
You can seemlessly add your voice to GIFs and Videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chestream and AngelHack, Delhi &ndash; June 20-21, 2015</p>

<p><a href="href="http://angelhack.com">http://angelhack.com</a>"  <a target="_blank">AngelHack</a> is the biggest Global Hackthon Series in the world hosted every year at over 25 cities including LA, Hong Kong, London, Abu Dhabi, India, Silicon Valley, Tokyo, Cairo, Zurich, Moscow, Bangok, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/images/angelhack.png" title="" ></p>

<p>With a total participation of 42 teams, this was more than just a normal Hackathon, as the winners would get an invite to the HACKcelerator program and an opportunity to present their project at the AngelHackâ€™s global event to be held in Silicon Valley.
There were also prizes for different categories like Amazon, HP, Mozilla, Clusterpoint, Branch.io and IBM Bluemix, where you had to use their technology innovatively and efficiently.</p>

<p>We had a balanced team of 5 people : Saurav Tomar, Umair Khan, Naman Dwivedi, Prempal Singh and I, strong in Android dev, UI/UX design and backend tech.
Over 30 hours (overnight), we developed <a href="href="http://chestream.com">http://chestream.com</a>"  <a target="_blank">Chestream</a> a new social network around video streaming.</p>

<img src="/images/chestream3.png" title="" ></p>

<p>Chestream is like Meerkat/ Periscope, but is linear and synchronous, i.e. only one person streams at a given time, and who gets to stream is decided by the number of upvotes, they&rsquo;ve got on their stream description and teaser(GIF) prior to them going live. As soon as one stream gets over, the next one is loaded.
An upvoting system ensures that the creamy layer of the videos is prevalent. So people will view the same content all around the world, not limited by demographics and social circle, upvoted by all unanimously.
Motivation: Content on apps like Meerkat and Periscope is increasing exponentially, and quality is not assured. Since this is non-archival content, it has only immediate value.
Chestream&rsquo;s social network is similar to Tumblr / Reddit and is one to many in nature.</p>

<p>Judges were impressed, when we pitched our project and shortlisted us. In the second round, we answered the various questions raised and won their confidence. They liked the concept and found it very different and exciting. Ultimately we won the Hackathon as well as the Clusterpoint challenge, got an invite to HACKcelerator program, opportunity to present our app at the Global Demo Day in Silicon Valley, California and a smartwatch.</p>

<li>Upvote the streams you like.</li>
<li>Only the most top voted streams get played, in descending order of upvotes.</li>
