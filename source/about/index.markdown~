Hi,

I am Laavanye Bahl (quite obvious), 21 year old, studying Software Engineering at Delhi Colllege of Engineering (DTU), currently in my final year.
I am a developer with 3 years of experience, especially Android and like to discover new technologies and things in general.

Talking about my latest work,
I completed my Google Summer of Code project recently and here is the link to the blog : {%link https://www.facebook.com/laavanye.bahl GSoC Final Submission %}

**P.S.** - I had started this blog in my 1st year with some introductory information written below :p

Just last year I graduated from Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi where I spent 13 wonderful years.
The thing I'll always love about Modern is that it never focused only on studies. It gave the the much seeked freedom to do what you like.

Feels like yesterday, happy kids throwing graduation hats in the air, enjoying the last few days together in the instituition.

Selecting the college was a tough task. After irritating my seniors, friends, family and teachers for advice I finally chose DTU over HKUST. I always wanted to study here. 
This is a picture from the terrace of the astounding campus.

Not lately, but I've always tried to take out time for some of my interests like â€“ basketball, theatre, sketching and playing the acoustic guitar.
