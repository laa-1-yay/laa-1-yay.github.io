Hey guys, so I've developed this Android App to make your life much easier. 

I have always wanted to build products for people which solved an everyday problem and this is once such attempt. 
I was used to spending a lot of time in first finding the top English songs and then obtaining them through various sites which involved a lot of ads.

So I developed this app to let you download Billboard top 100 songs of that particular time all at once with a button click permanently as files.     

No subscriptions. No redirection links. No surveys. No conversion time. 
You don't have to go through the hassle of looking for each song separately and downloading them. 
It's the best way to stay updated and have the latest playlist at all times.
You also get a notification when a new song enters the list.
I hope y'all like it! !
