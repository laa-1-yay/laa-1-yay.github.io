CoDelhi - This was our first Hackathon organized at DTU in association with the Google Developer Groups.

We formed our team - initially called "codeminators" that includes Raghav, Puja, Anshul and me and came 2nd in this event.
This will always be important as it gave us the required boost and motivation.

In those 36 hrs we developed Baba Predicton which is basically an app for leisure. You ask a question about the Future in Yes or No and get the answer in terms of a humorous song. Often simple funny things go viral, right ? ;)
