Hi,


I am Laavanye Bahl (quite obvious), 19 years old, studying Software Engineering at Delhi Colllege of Engineering (DTU), currently in my 1st year.

You can contact me at mail@laavanyebahl.com.
 
Just last year I graduated from Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi where I spent 13 wonderful years.
The thing I'll always love about Modern is that it never focused only on studies. It gave the the much seeked freedom to do what you like.


Feels like yesterday, happy kids throwing graduation hats in the air, enjoying the last few days together in the instituition.

Selecting the college was a tough task. After irritating my seniors, friends, family and teachers for advice I finally chose DTU over HKUST.
I always wanted to study here. This is a picture I clicked from the terrace of the astoundung campus.

Some of the things I love - basketball, theatre, sketching, guitar and coding.

After attending few workshops, I realized Android Development was the most interesting.

I thank [Arnav Gupta](blog.championswimmer.in) for the constant help ,advice and motivation. 

I look forward to develop
