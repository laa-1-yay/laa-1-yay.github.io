Chestream and AngelHack, Delhi - June 20-21, 2015

{%link http://angelhack.com AngelHack %} is the biggest Global Hackthon Series in the world hosted every year at over 25 cities including LA, Hong Kong, London, Abu Dhabi, India, Silicon Valley, Tokyo, Cairo, Zurich, Moscow, Bangok, etc.

This was more than just a normal Hackathon, as the winners would get an invite for the HACKcelerator program and an opportunity to present themselves at the AngelHackâ€™s global event to be held in Silicon Valley.

There were also prizes for different categories like Amazon, HP, Mozilla, Clusterpoint, Branch.io and IBM Bluemix, where you had to use their technology innovatively and efficiently.

We had a balanced team of 5 people : Saurav Tomar, Umair Khan, Naman Dwivedi, Prempal Singh and I ; strong in Android Dev, UI/UX Design and Backend Tech.

Over 30 hours (overnight), we developed {%link http://chestream.com Chestream %} a new social network around video streaming.

Chestream is like Meerkat/ Periscope, but is linear and synchronous, i.e. only one person streams at a given time, and who gets to stream is decided by the number of upvotes, they've got on their stream description and teaser(GIF) prior to them going live. As soon as one stream gets over, the next one is loaded.

An upvoting system ensures that the creamy layer of the videos is prevalent. So people will view the same content all around the world, not limited by demographics and social circle, upvoted by all unanimously. 

Motivation: Content on apps like Meerkat and Periscope is increasing exponentially, and quality is not assured. Since this is non-archival content, it has only immediate value. 

The idea behind this project was derived from the act of recording videos live from your device kept in your t-shirt pocket. i.e. to share with the world, the things you like, as you see them.

Chestream's social network is similar to Tumblr / Reddit and is one to many in nature. 

Currently it's an android app with the server side code written on flask framework using python and Clusterpoint was used as No SQL data base provider.

This is one of the few Hackathons that provides overnight stay. It was an amazing experience staying up all night, coding our way out with other developers.


Some features of our app :

- A streaming app that works on all networks, even 3G.
- Upvote the streams you like.
- Only the most top voted streams get played, in descending order of upvotes.
- 

We are trying our best to release the beta version as soon as possible. You can get the latest updates at {%link http://chestream.com chestream.com %}.
