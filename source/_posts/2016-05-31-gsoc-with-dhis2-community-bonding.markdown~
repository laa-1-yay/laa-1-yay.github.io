Hi,

I am overwhelmed to get selected for GSoC 2016. I would be working with the {%link https://www.dhis2.org/ DHIS2 %} organization.

It is the preferred health management information system in 47 countries and 23 organizations across four continents. DHIS 2 helps governments and health organizations to manage their operations more effectively, monitor processes and improve communication.

My project is : {%link  https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5382475769446400 Enhancing Dashboard Android App %}.  Current version of DHIS2 android dashboard application uses static images/HTML pages to represent information, which is limiting compared to the web version which allows to drill down into data.

Following are some of the areas I would be working on :

- Reimplementing syncing logic with the general sdk
- Generating the analytical objects dynamically
- Making the app work in the offline mode
- Many other UI/UX improvements

Dashboard app is intended for organizing and to provide quick access to different analytical objects (maps, charts, reports, tables, etc) to an individual user. 

It has been developed for Web, Desktop and Mobile. 
The various applications can be downloaded from {%link https://www.dhis2.org/downloads here %}


Community Bonding period was used for :

- Introduction
- Know more about the community
- Study the code 
- Read documentations 
- Discussing timeline with the mentor

I would like to thank my mentor Araz Abishov for the continuous guidance.

It feels great to be a part of a community of active developers and members working on development and implementation of health information systems across the world and I hope to complete the project with meaningful contributions.
