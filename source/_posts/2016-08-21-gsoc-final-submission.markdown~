Hi,
This is a blog post about my work, which I did during Google Summer of Code, 2016 with DHIS2 (District Health Information System).

So, the 3 month long program finally comes to an end !

It has been a really good experience working with the open source community, and it's exciting to see the project meet it's requirements.

A big thank you to my mentor Araz Abishov for being so appreciative and helpful.
Following are the 2 links to the repositories, I contributed to, which shows the work done by me.
