GSF Hacks - April 19-20, 2014

Hosted at Investopad, it is surely the best hackathon I've attended till now.
They selected top participants from a HackerEarth coding event. Hence, it was challenging.

GSF Accelerator is the initiative of Rajesh Sawhney, founder of GSF Superangels, a 
network of 30 leading digital founders and investors ,the single 
largest funding platform for the Indian start-ups.

Our team - codeminators (Raghav , Puja and me) participated in the shine.com challenge and came second.

shine.com, an initiative of Hindustan Times is an online portal for finding jobs. Registration pages are often lengthy , boring and time consuming. So the task was to make their mobile app fast, efficient and easy to use. 


This is one of the few Hackathons that provides overnight stay. It was an amazing experience staying up all night, coding our way out with other developers.


They made sure they provided the fuel to keep us going - #unlimitedRedBull

There were a lot of fun activities as well at regualar intervals to win goodies and relax the mind.

Some features of our app :

- An OCR to read CV images/Pdf and parse the useful information.
- Filling the Registration page via a Siri like Voice Assistant, 
  question after question.
- Skipping questions belonging to a particular category, if that 
  category doesn't satisfy.
- Feature to record a SOP so that the recruiter can test the   
  employee's speaking skills.
