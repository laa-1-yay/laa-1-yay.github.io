GSF Hacks - April 19-20, 2014

It is surely the best hackathon I've attended till now. It was hosted at Investopad which is the perfect place.
They selected top participants from a HackerEarth coding event. Hence, it was a great to challenge.

GSF Accelerator is the initiative of Rajesh Sawhney, founder of GSF Superangels, a 
network of 30 leading digital founders and investors ,the single 
largest funding platform for the Indian start-ups.

I had a great team - codeminators (Raghav , Puja and me)
We participated in the shine.com challenge and came second.

shine.com, an initiative of Hindustan Times is an online portal to find jobs. Registration pages are often lengthy , boring and time consuming. So the challenge was to make their mobile app fast, efficient and easy to use.

This is one of the few Hackathons that provides overnight stay. It is a great experience staying up all night, coding our way out with other developers.
