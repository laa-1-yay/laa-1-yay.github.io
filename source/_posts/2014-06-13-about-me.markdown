Hi,


I am Laavanye Bahl (quite obvious), 19 years old, studying Software Engineering at Delhi Colllege of Engineering (DTU), currently in my 1st year.


Few things I like - basketball, theatre, sketching, guitar and coding. 

Just last year I graduated from Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi where I spent 13 wonderful years.
The thing I'll always love about Modern is that it never focused only on studies. It gave the the much seeked freedom to do what you like.


Feels like yesterday, happy kids throwing graduation hats in the air, enjoying the last few days together in the instituition.

Selecting the college was a tough task. After irritating my seniors, friends, family and teachers for advice I finally chose DTU over HKUST.
I always wanted to study here. This is a picture from the terrace of the astounding campus.

After attending few workshops, I realized Android Development was the most interesting.

I thank {%link http://blog.championswimmer.in Arnav Gupta %} for introducing android to me and for the constant help ,advice and motivation.
